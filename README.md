# Wreck-it_Ralph Arcade Software
An arcade game starring Wreck It Ralph, where you try to destroy the building - preventing Felix from fixing it.

This is a fan creation of a fictional game. Not for distribution or sale, home use only. Meant to simulate if the fictional company Tobikomi created a standalone Wreck-it Ralph Arcade Game to pair with their Fix-it Felix machines.

# Complile
This game was made entirely in Gamemaker Studio 2, recently updated to 2.3.1 so will require that version of the IDE or newer. It should compile fine for Windows or HTML, haven't test Mac or Linux.
